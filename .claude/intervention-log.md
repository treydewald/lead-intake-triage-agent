# Intervention Log — [PROJECT_NAME]

Append-only record of every deliberate pipeline-level decision (Scope Expansion, Continual Refinement, UI
Audit & Refinement, In-App Cohesion Audit, Implementation Planning depth, Continued Development,
QA/Repair, Portfolio Evaluation, documentation regeneration) run on this project, and what happened
afterward. Full schema, rationale, and the Intervention Registry vocabulary: `docs/intervention-
tracking.md` — don't restate the rules here, just follow them.

**Read by:** nothing in this pipeline yet, mechanically — this is Phase A evidence recording. A future
iteration's Pipeline Learning System (`meta/PIPELINE_LEARNING_SYSTEM.md`) reads across many projects'
copies of this file once enough of them exist to learn from.
**Written by:** any of the operations named above, immediately after it runs — one row, minimal fields,
copying facts already being decided or already recorded elsewhere (see `docs/intervention-tracking.md`
§5 for exactly what to copy from where).

## Log

[Append-only, chronological. Never delete or edit a past entry — outcomes get filled in as a follow-up
edit to that same entry once the round they belong to is scored, not a new entry.]

### 2026-09-04 — implementation_planning_deep
- Trigger: Feature 07 (Outcome Notification — In-App) reached Step 5.5 before its Step 6 build; spec
  classified as a Deep-tier plan since it touches shared orchestrator plumbing at multiple call sites,
  not one isolated module.
- Expected effect (Predicted Footprint, `architecture-plan-feature-07.md`): ~10 files across new
  stage/model/schema/router/migration modules plus `graph.py`/`reviews.py`/`state.py`/
  `routers/__init__.py`/`models/__init__.py` modifications.
- Outcome (Actual Footprint, same file): 14 files changed — architecturally identical to the plan; the
  only differences were the test footprint splitting into 2 files instead of 1 predicted line item, and
  5 pre-existing test assertions needing updates because they encoded the pre-fix
  `RunStatus.RUNNING`/no-notification-on-failure behavior (already anticipated by the plan's own Risk
  section). 102/102 backend tests passed on the first full run; no rework cycle needed.
- Surprise: the plan's own Existing Systems Analysis surfaced a genuine pre-existing gap unrelated to
  Feature 07's literal scope — `RunStatus.COMPLETED` had zero assignment sites anywhere in the
  codebase before this round — and fixed it as part of this feature rather than deferring it, since
  Feature 07's own auto-processed/in-progress distinction is what exposed it.
